my mistakes are my life
I can't go on, I'll go on.
words are all we have
what's that unforgettable line?
habit is a great deadener
how hideous is the semicolon
reality is not always probable
life itself is a quotation
time is living me
to speak is a tautology
to think is to forget
art is fire plus algebra
in this world beautys so common
